        <h1>Netflix</h1>
        <p>Netflix today announced the return of its global phenomenon, Squid Game, for a third and final season — premiering June 27. 
        The news, shared by Bela Bajaria, Netflix’s Head of Content, at Next on Netflix arrives alongside exclusive first-look stills and a tantalizing glimpse into the fate of the surviving players.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Picking up where the second season left off, Season 3 explores the choices Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) will make amidst overwhelming despair. As the Front Man (Lee Byung-hun) plots his next move, the surviving players find their decisions leading to increasingly dire consequences with each round of the deadly games. This season promises to push the limits of suspense and drama, keeping viewers glued to the action.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The newly revealed launch poster delivers a chilling visual punch: a pink guard drags a bloodied contestant toward a coffin wrapped in a pink ribbon. Gone is the rainbow-hued track of Season 2’s six-legged pentathlon; in its place, a vividly swirling flower-pattern floor ominously foreshadows the cutthroat finale to come.  The sinister silhouettes of Young-hee and her companion Cheol-su — first hinted in last season’s post-credit scene — suggest that even more brutal games lie ahead.</p>
